# SIH-24-ML
This is the Machine Learning Data and Algorithm I curated and developed for SIH 2024, which predicts the Load (in MW) or the current usage at different times of the day.

These times are 9:00, 12:00, 15:00, 21:00, and for the Load Data at these times, I have written a script to scrape data from the given website using Postman, which saves the data to a file, appending to the file so that previous data is not lost.

## Data Sources
The historical Load data was taken from the Delhi SDLC website, at: https://www.delhisldc.org/, using Load Curve data at: https://www.delhisldc.org/Loadcurve.aspx

The historical weather data was taken from World Weather Online, at: https://www.worldweatheronline.com/new-delhi-weather-history/delhi/in.aspx
