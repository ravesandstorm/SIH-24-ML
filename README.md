# SIH-24-ML
This is the Machine Learning Data and Algorithm I curated and developed for SIH 2024, which predicts the Load (in MW) or the current usage at different times of the day.

These times are 9:00, 12:00, 15:00, 21:00. I have also written a script for scraping load data from the given website.

## Data Sources
The historical Load data was taken from the Delhi SDLC website, at: https://www.delhisldc.org/, using Load Curve data at: https://www.delhisldc.org/Loadcurve.aspx

The historical weather data was taken from World Weather Online, at: https://www.worldweatheronline.com/new-delhi-weather-history/delhi/in.aspx
